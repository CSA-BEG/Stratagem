    Game Systems
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both sides start with their castle, 5 gold, and some AP(action points). Each turn you gain gold acording
to the buildings you have built. Gold is distributed as follows:
Wall - 1 Gold
Castle - 2 Gold
Sawmill - 3 Gold
You gain AP as the game progresses, the first player starts with only one, the second player starts with two.
Each turn that passes yields two more AP for each player, capping at 12 AP. All actions in the game require AP.

The Tent and Graveyard allow the player to build units. The two buldings allow for different types of units
to be built, as follows:
Graveyard - Skeletons and Cyclops'
Tent - Knights and Mages

Stats as follows:
Skeleton - Cost=3, movement distance=4, Health=5
Cyclops - Cost=5, movement distance=2, Health=7
Knight - Cost=4, movement distance=3, Health=6
Mage - Cost=6, movement distance=5, Health=4

Attack is equivalent to health, and enough damage must be dealt in a single turn to destroy units and buildings,
except for the castles. All buildings have 10 health.

    Controls
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WASD to move the cursor and units. Space bar to perform actions. Pressing space once brings up an invisible
context menu in which you chose from a list of actions to perform. Pressing space again performs the action.
Despite this, everything but units only has one action. When using a unit, if they are within attacking range
of an enemy, they can attack, or move. Pressing D should ensure that the player moves the unit, Pressing A should
ensure the player attacks another unit. For all other purposes, simply press space twice. Press E should exit the
context menu.

You can only build buildings on empty spaces on your side of the field.

good luck
