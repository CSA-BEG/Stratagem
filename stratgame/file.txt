Game Systems

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Both sides start with their castle, 5 gold, and some AP(action points). Each turn you gain gold acording

to the buildings you have built. Gold is distributed as follows:

Wall - 1 Gold

Castle - 2 Gold

Sawmill - 3 Gold


The four possible buildings and costs are as follows:
Sawmill (option 1) - 5 Gold
Tent (option 2) - 7 Gold
Graveyard (option 3) - 6 Gold
Wall (option 4) - 4 Gold

You gain AP as the game progresses, the first player starts with only one, the second player starts with two.

Each turn that passes yields two more AP for each player, capping at 12 AP. All actions in the game require AP.


The Tent and Graveyard allow the player to build units. The two buldings allow for different types of units

to be built, as follows:
Graveyard - Skeletons and Cyclops'

Tent - Knights and Mages



Stats as follows:

Skeleton - Cost=3, movement distance=4, Health=5

Cyclops - Cost=5, movement distance=2, Health=7

Knight - Cost=4, movement distance=3, Health=6

Mage - Cost=6, movement distance=5, Health=4



Attack is equivalent to health, and enough damage must be dealt in a single turn to destroy units and buildings,

except for the castles. All buildings have 10 health, except for the castles, which have 30 health.
